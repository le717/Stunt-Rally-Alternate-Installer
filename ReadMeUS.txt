2. TECHNICAL DETAILS
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.1 [OPERATING SYSTEM]

LEGO STUNT RALLY has been designed to run on Microsoft Windows 95 & Microsoft Windows 98 
only. The game has been tested using the following operating systems:

  > Microsoft Windows 95A
  > Microsoft Windows 95B (OSR2)

  > Microsoft Windows 98
  > Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition

The game was NOT designed to run on the following operating systems:

  > Windows NT
  > OS/2
  > Linux 
  > Windows 2000

LEGO STUNT RALLY has not been designed to run on Windows Millenium, but has been found to work on some systems.
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.2 [CPU]

Please note that a Pentium II 233 MHz MMX or equivalent is required to run the game at 
an acceptable level.

NON INTEL CPU's: 

 > AMD: It is recommended that the game is run on an AMD K6-2 300Mhz or higher to run 
        the game at acceptable performance levels.

 > Cyrix: It is recommended that the game is run on a Cyrix MII 300 to run 
          the game at acceptable performance levels.

 > IDT WinChip: No testing was carried out using this type CPU therefore no 
                recommendations or assumptions can or will be made.
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.3 [MEMORY]

32MB of system RAM is required for the game to run.

Some systems may state that they have 32MB RAM installed, however, due to certain video 
adapters this may not be entirely true.

   Shared Video RAM: Some video adapters will allocate 2-4 MB of SYSTEM RAM to use as
                     Video RAM. This means your system may actually only have 28-30 MB
                     of SYSTEM RAM available.

   Dynamically Shared Video RAM: Some Video adapters can allocate SYSTEM RAM dynamically.
 				 The amount allocated can range from 0.5MB to 8MB so you
				 may have as little as 24MB of SYSTEM RAM available.


   >>>> PLEASE CONTACT YOUR HARDWARE MANUFACTURER FOR DETAILS IF YOU ARE UNSURE <<<<

_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.4 [VIDEO]

8MB of video RAM is required to run LEGO STUNT RALLY. Some older model computers may
come with a video adapter that has less than 8MB of memory. In this situation, the 
game may run and appear to function correctly, however a decrease in performance will 
result. It is NOT recommended that LEGO STUNT RALLY is run on Video adapters with less 
than 8MB.

Video Drivers: 
What is a video driver?
A Video driver acts as a link between the video adapter (hardware) and the operating 
system and allows it to perform the functions requested by an application.

Manufacturers of Video adapters regularly publish new DRIVERS for their products. 
These are made available for FREE from their WEB site. 

If you are using old drivers for your Video adapter you may experience some unwanted 
graphical corruption while running LEGO STUNT RALLY.
Graphical problems can often be resolved by updating the drivers for your video adapter.
Note: Updating the Video drivers your system uses may improve performance and solve
issues over a wide range of applications and games.

 >>>> PLEASE CONTACT YOUR HARDWARE MANUFACTURER FOR DETAILS CONCERNING DRIVERS <<<<
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.5 [CD/DVD ROM DRIVE] 

LEGO STUNT RALLY Requires a 4X CD-ROM Drive or greater. The faster your CD-ROM Drive the 
greater the rate at which data can be read from the CD. This is important when viewing 
the front-end movies when you start LEGO STUNT RALLY.
SLOWER drives will also result in longer installation times.

DVD Drives usually specify 2 numbers e.g. 6X / 32X . These two numbers are the speeds at 
which data from a DVD-ROM and a CD-ROM is read. Generally the second number, 32X in this 
case, defines the speed at which data is read from a CD. 

LEGO STUNT RALLY CD-ROM - The LEGO STUNT RALLY CD MUST be present in the CD/DVD drive for the 
game to run.
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.6 [SOUND CARD] 

LEGO STUNT RALLY requires a sound card that is fully compatible with DirectX 7. This is 
true in most cases, however some old legacy cards will not be compatible.

As with video adapters, updated sound card DRIVERS are regularly published by hardware 
manufacturers and are available for FREE off their web site.

If you experience any sound corruption or other sound related problems during game play, 
you should update your sound drivers. This will often solve sound related problems.


 >>>> PLEASE CONTACT YOUR HARDWARE MANUFACTURER FOR DETAILS CONCERNING DRIVERS <<<<
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.7 [DIRECTX 7]

LEGO STUNT RALLY requires the latest version of Microsoft's DirectX software to be 
installed on your system. The latest version of DirectX (currently), DirectX 7, is 
supplied on the LEGO STUNT RALLY CD-ROM. You will be asked if you wish to install the 
DirectX components during the installation of LEGO STUNT RALLY.

Choose YES when asked if you wish to update DirectX components. You will need to RESTART 
your machine for changes to take effect.

For more information and the latest updates concerning Microsoft's DirectX go to:

		http://www.microsoft.com/directx/
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.8 [INPUT DEVICES]

WHEEL MOUSE:
LEGO STUNT RALLY supports the use of a Microsoft Wheel Mouse to scroll through menus.
Users of Microsoft Windows 95A & 95B (OSR2) may need to update their Wheel Mouse Drivers 
or install Microsoft IntelliPoint Version 2.1 or later for the wheel function to operate 
correctly while playing LEGO STUNT RALLY.

IntelliPoint 2.1 is available for download from:

		http://www.microsoft.com
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.9 [OUTPUT DEVICES]

When printing, LEGO STUNT RALLY may minimize and drop to your desktop, passing
the print job to your print manager software.

Please make sure that your printer is installed correctly and is on-line, ready to print.
To resume play, press the LEGO STUNT RALLY tab on the TASKBAR.
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.10 [INSTALLATION SIZE]

LEGO STUNT RALLY allows you to choose from a number of installation options to best suit 
your system.

   Minimal - 200MB : This option will only install the game files to your computer's hard drive.  Video files will be run from the LEGO STUNT RALLY game CD.

   Full	 - 350MB : This option installs all files from the CD to your computers hard drive. 
The game CD is still required to play LEGO STUNT RALLY.
		
	
Swapfile : Like most programs LEGO STUNT RALLY requires the use of a swap file within the 
Windows environment. Swapfiles act as virtual memory where instructions and data are 
temporarily stored on the hard drive.

LEGO STUNT RALLY requires 100MB approx. of free hard drive space after installation, to
ensure optimal software performance.

* = Uncompressed Hard drive space - meaning that the hard drive has not been subjected
to any form of file compression which allows the hard drive space to be increased.
For example under Windows 98 the option that would usually be used to
perform this function would be DriveSpace.

3. LEGO STUNT RALLY - FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
_________________________________________________________________________________________

Q. When I start LEGO STUNT RALLY I get the message "You must be running in 256 colour 
   mode or higher" and LEGO STUNT RALLY will not run. What do I do ?

A. LEGO STUNT RALLY requires that your desktop colour depth is set to 16bit colour or greater.
   It is unlikely that you will be running at a colour depth of less than 16bit colour 
   (i.e. 256 colours), however it is possible. To change your desktop colour depth :

  1. Click START on the taskbar, then choose SETTINGS > CONTROL PANEL.
  2. Choose DISPLAY from the icon list, this will bring up the DISPLAY PROPERTIES panel.
  3. Choose the SETTINGS tab, then select - High Colour (16 bit) - 
  4. Apply changes and restart the machine if prompted to.

Q. When I run the LEGO STUNT RALLY installer, it asks me if I want to update my DirectX 
   components.

  1. Should I do this?
  2. How do I check what version of DirectX is on my system?

A.1. YES. LEGO STUNT RALLY requires DirectX 7 to be installed on your system to function 
     correctly. 
  2. The method of checking which version of DirectX is installed is the same for 
     Windows 95 and 98. Double click on My Computer and follow this path:

		C: (C Drive) > Program files > DirectX > Setup

     In the Setup folder you should see a Dxinfo icon (Dxinfo.exe) or a Dxsetup 
     (Dxsetup.exe) Icon. Running either of these will allow you to see what version of
     DirectX you have installed on your system.

Q. I updated my DirectX components, tried to run LEGO STUNT RALLY after the installation and it crashed to the desktop. What happened ?     

A. If you choose to update your DirectX version you MUST restart your computer after the
   installation process is complete. LEGO STUNT RALLY will not function until the system has been
   restarted.


Q. LEGO STUNT RALLY keeps minimising and Windows tells me that I am running out of space on 
   Drive C:
   What should I do?

A. Windows will give you the option to run the disk Clean-up utility which can delete 
   Temporary, Temporary Internet and Recycle Bin files (All can safely be deleted). This
   can free up some hard drive space.

Please make sure there is 100MB of disk space available for Windows to create a swap file during LEGO STUNT RALLY play.

Q. Why does my Microsoft Wheel Mouse not function in LEGO STUNT RALLY in-game MENUS?

A. This has been shown to occur when using Windows 95A and Windows 95B (OSR2). To resolve 
   this problem you should update your Wheel Mouse drivers or install Microsoft 
   IntelliPoint Version 2.1 or greater. This is available as a FREE download at:

		http://www.microsoft.com

Q. The front-end movie plays when I start LEGO STUNT RALLY but it appears to be jerky. 
   Why is this?

A. This can be due to several factors:

  1. The CD may need cleaning - remove it from the drive and use a soft cotton cloth, 
     wiping outwards from the centre of the disc.

     CD Care: 
     Compact discs are very easily damaged if treated carelessly. Such 
     damage has a much greater effect on the digital data of a CD-ROM than on the 
     information of a music CD. A dirty or damaged CD-ROM is quite likely to
     malfunction. As CD-ROM drives become ever faster and more disc-sensitive, 
     this is an increasing problem. 

     The surface of the disc can quickly gather dirt and is easily scratched. 
     To protect the data from scratches, fingerprints, dust particles, and smears, 
     do not touch the data side (unlabelled side) of the disc. Also, never place it 
     face down on a hard surface. 
     
     Never leave the disc in a place subject to direct sunlight, high temperature, 
     or high humidity. Recommended storage conditions are: 

     Temperature: 10°C to 50°C (50°F to 122°F) 
     Humidity: 10 percent to 80 percent. 

     With proper care, CDs can have a long and productive life.
 
  2. Check that your CD-ROM is 4X or greater - slower drives do not meet the minimum 
     specification

  3. Some odd effects have been seen when using very high speed drives, (40X +) sometimes
     the movie will play fine and at other times it will not. Restart your computer then 
     try to run LEGO STUNT RALLY again.

  4. If problems still occur with video playback, please re-install LEGO STUNT RALLY and install the game videos to your computers Hard Drive.

Q. No Sound/Music will play or is corrupted when I play LEGO STUNT RALLY. What should I do ?

A. Should this problem arise you should try the following:

  1. You may be running older drivers for your sound card. Updating these drivers may 
     solve your problems. If you have Internet access you can download the latest drivers 
     for your hardware for FREE from your hardware manufacturer's web site.
      
   >>>> PLEASE CONTACT YOUR HARDWARE MANUFACTURER FOR DETAILS IF YOU ARE UNSURE <<<<

  
  2. Other programs running within Windows may be causing conflicts. You can shut these 
     down by holding down CTRL + ALT + DEL. This will bring up the Task Manager
     (CLOSE PROGRAM BOX) allowing you to close down programs individually. Closing all 
     programs except SYSTRAY and EXPLORER may solve your sound problems.

Q. When I start LEGO STUNT RALLY I get a black screen or the game will drop back to the desktop.
   What should I do ?

A. Should this problem arise you should try the following:

  1. You may be running on older drivers for your Video card. Updating these drivers may 
     solve your problems. If you have Internet access you can download the latest drivers 
     for your hardware for FREE from your hardware manufacturer's web site.
      
   >>>> PLEASE CONTACT YOUR HARDWARE MANUFACTURER FOR DETAILS IF YOU ARE UNSURE <<<<

  
  2. Other programs running within Windows may be causing conflicts. You can shut these 
     down by holding down CTRL + ALT + DEL. This will bring up the Task Manager
     (CLOSE PROGRAM BOX) allowing you to close down programs individually. Closing all 
     programs except SYSTRAY and EXPLORER, may solve your video problems.

  3. DirectX 7 may not be installed correctly on your system. A re-installation of 
     LEGO STUNT RALLY (choosing YES when asked if you wish to update DirectX components) may 
     solve your video problems. Or you can download DirectX 7 for FREE from:

		http://www.microsoft.com/directx

Q. When I exit the game why has my Windows desktop either increased or decreased in size?

A. LEGO STUNT RALLY automatically adjusts the resolution of your Desktop area to 640 x 480 or 800 x 600 depending on the games current configuration.  This is done to conform to the requirements of the game.
   If the desktop size does not return to its normal appearance then please see the 
   following information on how to adjust the display properties of your system.

   To change you desktop resolution :

  1. Click START on the taskbar, then choose SETTINGS > CONTROL PANEL.
  2. Choose DISPLAY from the icon list, this will bring up the DISPLAY PROPERTIES panel.
  3. Choose the SETTINGS tab, then select the SCREEN AREA you want e.g. 800 x 600
  4. Apply changes and restart the machine if prompted to.

Q. I noticed some graphical errors during the Installation of LEGO STUNT RALLY. 
   Is this a problem ?

A. NO. This does not affect the installation of LEGO STUNT RALLY but may arise if your desktop
   colour depth is 256 or lower. See Question 1 on details of how to change your colour
   depth.

Q. I pressed ALT + TAB to swap between programs and LEGO STUNT RALLY stopped responding when I 
   switched back. 

A. This problem may occur when running other programs in the background during game play.
   It is recommended that you close all other programs before playing LEGO STUNT RALLY.

In some situations it is recommended that you do not use Alt-Tab when running LEGO STUNT RALLY.

Q. I am running low on disk space and LEGO STUNT RALLY will not run.

A. If you have little or no space left on your hard drive after the installation of 
LEGO STUNT RALLY you may encounter some problems trying to run the game. LEGO STUNT RALLY requires that
you have at least 100MB free AFTER installation, for Windows to create a swapfile for the
game. This is especially important if you are using a minimum specification machine.

Q. I have Windows 95 and I've installed LEGO STUNT RALLY but NO sound will play during the intro.
   What can I do ?

A. This problem arises when certain multimedia components of Windows 95 are not installed.
   To solve this problem do the following:

	Go to the Control Panel
	Select ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS
	Select the WINDOWS SETUP tab
	Select MULTIMEDIA
	Make sure all components are checked.

Windows may ask for the Windows 95 CD to install these components.
Reboot your machine and attempt to run LEGO STUNT RALLY again.	


Q. When I select 800 x 600 in the games options menu, the picture on my computers screen goes corrupt.

A. It is possible that your computers monitor is not capable of running a resolution of 800 x 600.  Please exit LEGO STUNT RALLY, or re-boot your computer.  It may be necessary to re-install LEGO STUNT RALLY to regain access to 640 x 480 mode.

Q. When I print, LEGO STUNT RALLY minimises to show the printer software supplied by my printer manufacturer.  When printing is complete, LEGO STUNT RALLY does not maximise back to the game.

A. In some situations, Windows software supplied by your printer manufacturer will take control of Windows during printing, and interfere with the functions of LEGO STUNT RALLY.  To correct this problem, please try to disable your printer's software.  See the information supplied with the printer.

Even with printer software disabled, you should still be able to print through LEGO STUNT RALLY using the normal Windows printer functions.

Many printer configurations vary, so if in doubt please contact your printers manufacturer.


Q. When I press Ctrl - Alt - Delete, LEGO STUNT RALLY minimises and crashes.

A. On some computer configurations, pressing these keys together may cause LEGO STUNT RALLY to inadvertently fail.  If this is the case, please refrain from using this key combination.


Q. Sometimes when I run LEGO STUNT RALLY the videos and sounds do not play smoothly or match up.

A. This can be caused by a number of reasons.

	Q. Your videos are being run from the CD ROM drive, which is not fast enough to play them smoothly.
	A.  Please install the videos to your computers HD for better performance.

	Q. Your computer does have the required 32MB of RAM but some of this may be used by other programs you are running within windows.  This will cause the game to write lots of data to your hard disk to create virtual memory.  If speech or sound effects are being played during this time, the game will run slowly until your hard drive has stopped working.
	A. Please close down as many programs as possible running on your Windows system, before running LEGO STUNT RALLY to avoid any memory problems on minimum spec machines (32MB).


Q. I have a Hercules Dynamite graphics card and the game refuses to run.

A. There are some known driver issues with this graphics card.  If the game refuses to run, please re-install the original drivers supplied with your graphics card.
